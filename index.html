       Students, as the future of our country, have the power to make our communities safer through effective legislation to prevent gun violence. Falcons to End Gun Violence works to help pass laws, such as Red Flag Laws and comprehensive background checks, that have been shown to reduce the deaths by gun violence in states that have implemented them. Red Flag Laws are a perfect example; states that have enacted them saw drastic reductions in firearm suicides.

       A common retort to the need for gun control measures is that we already have comprehensive background checks. The issue is that many of these laws have loopholes that allow a purchase to proceed by default  if it is not cleared in 3 days. March for Our Lives estimates that in March-May of 2020 the loophole “resulted in at least 91,500 potential default proceeds”

        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->

       Hi, I am Olivia Mostow and I am the founder of Falcons to End Gun Violence, and a rising senior at Briar Woods High School. I started the club because I was inspired by the work Moms Demand Action was doing and the wide range of opportunity to take action. It was difficult to find ways to work with other like-minded teens to achieve these goals, so I decided to create the space I wish I had in my first few years of high school. 

      </p>
